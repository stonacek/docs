# Optional: Setup and run a Gnosis Chain (formerly xDai) Node

{% hint style="info" %}
This process is optional and suggested for experienced node runners only.
{% endhint %}

While not mandatory (public RPC endpoint connection is possible), we encourage users to also run a Gnosis Chain L1 node to increase decentralization. You can run the GC client on the same machine where you run the Gnosis Beacon Chain client or choose a different setup.

Select either OpenEthereum or Nethermind as your client of choice. Follow these instructions to get started:

* [Nethermind](../../clients/gnosis-chain-node-openethereum-and-nethermind/nethermind-node-setup.md)
* [OpenEthereum](../../clients/gnosis-chain-node-openethereum-and-nethermind/openethereum-node-setup.md)

Once your node is setup, take note of the RPC endpoint -  you will need it later in the setup. The default is typically `http://x.x.x.x:8545` where `x.x.x.x` is your instance ip.&#x20;

**Additional client RPC endpoint info:**

* [Nethermind RPC](https://docs.nethermind.io/nethermind/ethereum-client/json-rpc) (JSON RPC needs to be explicitly switched on in the Nethermind `config` file)&#x20;
* [OpenEthereum RPC](https://openethereum.github.io/JSONRPC) (HTTP: Listens on port `8545`)

### 3rd Party Providers

Third party node providers are also an option for setting up and running a Gnosis (xDai) Chain Node.
